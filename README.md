# Bit Computer

## Overview

The Binary Computer provides essential functionalities for managing and processing binary data efficiently. It consists of classes such as Bit, Word, MainMemory, Processor, and ALU, offering a comprehensive framework for working with binary data and simulating processor execution.

## Features

- **Bit Manipulation:** The Bit class enables users to manipulate individual binary digits, perform logical operations, and query bit values.
- **Word Management:** The Word class represents 32-bit binary words, allowing users to manipulate bits, perform logical operations, and convert between signed and unsigned integers.
- **Main Memory Handling:** The MainMemory class facilitates storage and retrieval of binary data, supporting read, write, and load operations for Word objects.
- **Processor Execution:** The Processor class simulates processor execution, managing program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP), registers, and instruction execution.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU):** The ALU class implements arithmetic and logical operations on binary data, providing functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND, OR, XOR, and shifting.

## Key Data Structures

- **Arrays:** Arrays are extensively used to store registers, results, and memory, providing efficient storage and access to binary data.
- **Loops:** Loops, namely for loops, are employed for iterating over bits and performing operations on them efficiently.
- **Conditional Statements:** Conditional statements, including switch-case and if-else, are utilized for executing different operations based on opcode and instruction formats.
